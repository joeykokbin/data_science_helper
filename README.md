# data_science_helper

This project contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks aimed to provide a comprehensive guide for an end-to-end data science project, with a focus on the less glamorous parts (i.e. data processing, exploratory data analysis). Most if not all codes within this project are written using base python, which requires no installation of new packages.

Having the privilege of attending multiple courses in computer science, Python, and data science, I find myself in a great position to write up a guide to highlight key things to note when writing in Python, especially when dealing with errors and troubleshooting. Emphasis is given to intricacies and areas not really taught by courses (or skimmed through at superficial level), as well as based on relevancy to my work.

Nevertheless, this framework will be useful to gain a working knowledge in data science, which will be essential in insights generation and data-backed decision making.
