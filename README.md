# data_science_helper
A full library of notebooks to get beginner users started on Python and data science, with a focus on data processing.

Having learnt Python via Harvard's CS50x, I wanted to help new users bridge the gap between data science resources provided by local CSC courses and the fundamentals of Python, especially regarding the specifics of handling data. This is written based on my own Python version, which has not been updated since 2018 (due to work constraints). Users can run this with base Python without installing boutique Python packages.

The volume of Notebooks will provide detailed codes and walkthroughs from a practical point of view (where codes can break and debugging is needed). More emphasis is given to intricacies and things not really taught by course lecturers (or taught at a superficial level), and things I find important (particularly to colleagues in my own work organisation).

Hope this notebook helps you along your Python data science journey!
